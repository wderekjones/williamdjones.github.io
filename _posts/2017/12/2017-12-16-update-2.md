<!-- Our work "Polypharmacology Within the Full Kinome: a Machine Learning Approach" and " Incorporating Protein Dynamics Through Ensemble Docking in Machine Learning Models to Predict Drug Binding" has been accepted to the AMIA 2018 Informatics Summit in San Francisco. Our papers investigate the use of machine learning and various feature representations of the drug and protein molecule to better model their interactions. The first paper uses a large number of features and a random forest to classify between active versus decoy binding interactions. We outperform the state of the art in molecular docking by a factor of approximately 60% in correctly predicting active binding interactions. The second paper uses a number of conformations of the Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase or 'Lck' kinase as well as a large number of feature descriptors for the drug molecules. -->
