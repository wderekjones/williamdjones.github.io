Today I successfully defended my M.Sc thesis under the title &quot;Scalable Feature
Selection and Extraction With Applications in Kinase Polypharmacology&quot;. --&gt;

&lt;!--
During my first semester, I knew that I was interested in *&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;* or AI,
 but it did take time for me to find that area within such a large space that
 appealed to my personal intuitions. By taking a machine learning course, I thought
 that I would simply expose myself to a subfield that was gaining popularity for the
 sake of being up to date on what was going on in AI. I found myself spending much
 of my time reading about the algorithms and writing python/matlab code, languages that
 I as a C++ enthusiast (or least so I thought) had never taken very seriously. I
 completed a course project in which I used a convolutional neural network to classify genres
 of music and I found myself at the beginning of something new. The
next semester I decided that I wanted to gain hands-on experience with machine learning research,
and so I decided to join a computational drug discovery project with Dr. Sally Ellingson of the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center. If not for the
opportunity for Machine Learning research, I also felt that I had found a project that had tangible, practical
applications to address a problem that was in need of the technology I had found myself so fixated with. I
helped to aggregate a dataset for the binary classification problem of binding versus non-binding protein-drug
interactions along with my lab partners, Fatemah Alghamedy and Jeevith Bopaiah, and completed work for our first publication *&quot;Incorporating Protein Dynamics Through Ensemble Docking in Machine Learning Models to Predict Drug Binding&quot;*. Afterwards I traveled with Dr. Ellingson to Berkeley,CA where I spent the summer under the
supervision of Dr. Bert de Jong at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on expanding the scope of the methods in that work to multiple protein kinase targets, developing a feature selection algorithm based upon the feature importances that could be extracted from the random forest algorithm. From
that work came my first author publication *&quot;Polypharmacology Within the Full Kinome: A Machine Learning Approach&quot;*.

My time at Berkeley Labs inspired me to challenge myself to focus on methods that could scale up to large supercomputing clusters as well as down
to a 2010 dual-core macbook. I wanted to do so because I found the challenge to be stimulating and potentially useful in the case that I deal with
larger datasets in my future work, being able to leverage each core available to me in an efficient manner could save time when I'm processing the data
and or learning a model.

So with these skills and interests in hand, in my last semester of work I decided try a final project that would become the
second part of my thesis work and result in further refinement of my research interests in molecular machine learning. I
had a goal of simplifying the process used in my first paper to create something that would remove even more of the
required expertise to identify kinase inhibitors. The results from using a Message Passing Neural Network trained only
on the graph structures of the drug molecules (along with some atom and bond features) actually perform competitively
with the results where we use over 5,400 features for our random forest based method.

And so came my thesis, *&quot;Scalable Feature Selection and Extraction with Applications in Kinase Polypharmacology&quot;*. I did not have this sequence of events
planned exactly, but I allowed my interests to guide me along the way and I have to say that I am a bit surprised as to where I ended up. From here, I will travel to Livermore,CA to continue working on protein-drug interaction modeling with machine learning and then in the fall, begin working with the BioFrontiers Institute and Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Let's see what happens next! --&gt;

Our papers investigate the use of machine learning and various feature representations of the drug and protein molecule to better model their interactions. The first paper uses a large number of features and a random forest to classify between active versus decoy binding interactions. We outperform the state of the art in molecular docking by a factor of approximately 60% in correctly predicting active binding interactions. The second paper uses a number of conformations of the Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase or 'Lck' kinase as well as a large number of feature descriptors for the drug molecules. --&gt;</content><author><name>Derek Jones</name><email>jones289@llnl.gov</email></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Targeting Better Cancer Drugs through Berkeley Lab Partnership</title><link href="https://wderekjones.github.io/update-08-16-2017" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Targeting Better Cancer Drugs through Berkeley Lab Partnership" /><published>2017-08-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://wderekjones.github.io/update-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wderekjones.github.io/update-08-16-2017"></content><author><name>Derek Jones</name><email>jones289@llnl.gov</email></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html">Targeting Better Cancer Drugs through Berkeley Lab Partnership</summary></entry></feed>
